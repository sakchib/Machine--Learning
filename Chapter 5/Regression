Definition of Regression:
Regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors).
It is used to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the known values of the independent variables.
Key Concepts:
Dependent Variable (Target):

The variable to be predicted or explained (e.g., house price).
Independent Variables (Predictors):

The variables that influence or explain the dependent variable (e.g., house size, location).
Objective of Regression:

To find a mathematical relationship (equation) between the dependent and independent variables.
Types of Regression:
Linear Regression:

Model: 
𝑦=𝑚𝑥+𝑐
y=mx+c
Purpose: Predicts a dependent variable using a straight-line equation.
Example: Predicting house price based on size.
Multiple Linear Regression:

Model: 𝑦=𝑏0+𝑏1𝑥+1𝑏2𝑥2+…+𝑏𝑛𝑥𝑛y=b 0​ +b1​ x1​ +b 2​ x 2​ +…+b n​ x n​ 
Purpose: Extends linear regression to include multiple independent variables.
Example: Predicting house price based on size, location, and number of rooms.
Polynomial Regression:

Model: 𝑦=𝑏0+ 1𝑥+𝑏2𝑥2+…+𝑏𝑛𝑥𝑛y=b 0​ +b 1​ x+b 2​ x 2 +…+b n​ x n 
Purpose: Models nonlinear relationships by using higher-order terms of the independent variable.
Example: Modeling the relationship between time and sales growth.
Logistic Regression:

Model: Used for binary classification (e.g., yes/no outcomes).
Output: Probability values (between 0 and 1).
Example: Predicting if a customer will buy a product or not.
Ridge and Lasso Regression:

Purpose: Regularized versions of linear regression to prevent overfitting.
Ridge: Adds L2 penalty (sum of squared coefficients).
Lasso: Adds L1 penalty (sum of absolute coefficients).
Nonlinear Regression:

Purpose: Models relationships that are not linear by fitting more complex equations.
Example: Predicting population growth with exponential models.
Time Series Regression:

Purpose: Predicts values over time by considering temporal dependencies.
Example: Stock market prediction based on historical data.
